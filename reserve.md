          However, I'm at the beginning of my Web development journey,I'm
          quietly confident, naturally curious, and continuously working on
          improving my skills.

          Currently, I'm a student at the Digital Career Institute and following
          graduating I would like to gain my first experiences as a Front-end
          developer and Web designer.

          I'm interested in freelance and would be happy to work remotely for
          agencies,consult for startups, and collaborate with talented people to
          create digital products for both business and consumer use.
